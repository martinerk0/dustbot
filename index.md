## DustBot Robot documentation

- ### 3d model
o	Iterated developments how requirements ands ideas changed - iterated development of robot design 
o	Requirement
o	Reuse of 3rd party models aka case for raspberry or camera

- ### modelling tool 
- There are lot of expressive software to model physical things, but we chose thingiverse.com since we did not have any previous experience with 3D modelling
- project requirements:
    -	Learn about robotics
    -Learn about electronics
    -Build something that is working
    -not expensive, should use easily available components
    - sotfware oriented- hardware should be as simple as possible

- ### sensors
  o	Tactile
  o	Odometry
  o	Camera 
  o	Ultrasound?
